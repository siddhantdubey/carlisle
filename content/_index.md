# <u>Hi, I'm Siddhant.</u>

I'm a Computer Science major at the Georgia Institute of Technology and a software engineer and writer. I also enjoy making [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5opyqV7wblMILfowGlPPnA) that document my life or cover some topic that I happen to find particularly interesting.
