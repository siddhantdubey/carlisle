Five of my favorite books, songs, movies, and shows.

# **Books**
I've put these books here either because I greatly enjoyed reading them or I felt that they have had a profound impact on shaping me as a person.
It is more than likely that a book on this list satisfied both of those categories.

- [The Way of Kings]() by Brandon Sanderson. An incredible start to my favorite fantasy series of all time, *The Stormlight Archive*. Amazing worldbuilding with well fleshed out characters with believable faults and an incredibly captivating plot. Sure at more than 1000 pages, it is a little bit long, but I think it is worth it.
- [Cat's Cradle]() by Kurt Vonnegut. 
- [Dune]() by Frank Herbert.
- [A Monster Calls]() by Patrick Ness.
- [The Book Thief]() by Markus Zuzak.

This list will be ever changing, so these are my five favorite songs at the moment.
